<h3>The Significance of Dickies</h3>

Dickies have been in the American consciousness from their conception in 1922. Originally manufactured as a workman's uniform, they later became the outfitter of the U.S.'s armed forces during WWII. The sturdiness and homogeneity isn't restricted to a worker's field, however, as the brand has recently come to attract a variety of tastes.</li>
<li class="dickiesarticle">
Skateboarders, nurses, cholos, construction workers and many more people of various walks of life all wear them. The practicality of the material, a "quality, durability and comfort" that Dickies so vehemently prides itself on, has become only one aspect of the Dickies appeal. In the boxy button-ups and their signature stiff pants there's a cool nostalgia embedded because of the people they were intentionally and inadvertently made for. Workers had to wear them because they were the only brand that would last; skateboarders for the same reason. Eventually, others caught on and they became an emblem of a particular style, not necessarily one of occupation.</li>

<li class="dickiesarticle">
I wear them because they fit and they remind me of home. With a small waist and wide hips, pants that fit well have been always been difficult for me to find for most of my life. After taking my dad's old work jeans as a teenager, I discovered men's sizing. The waist and length and hip sizes are taken into account, which made my only concern the color or style when buying pants, specifically Dickies.</li>

<li class="dickiesarticle">
I'm from Los Angeles, home of skateboarders, construction workers and cholos - for me, at least. The men I grew up around often wore Dickies: whether it was my dad, who is a construction worker, his friends, or my typically male skateboarder friends, Dickies were always surrounded me.</li>

<li class="dickiesarticle">
They were what everyone wore in middle school when we were forced to wear the navy polo shirts and bottoms Dickies famously supplied in the San Fernando Valley. I used to resent the brand when I was restricted to wearing the women's line. Everything was too tight and effeminate for my 'tomboy' taste and chunky, pubescent shape.</li>

<li class="dickiesarticle">
It took me a long time to warm up to the brand after the trauma of middle school. But after witnessing the beginnings of their resurgence in my friends' wardrobes throughout high school, and after discarding societal norms myself, I was hooked. Not only are they loose and comfortable on the thighs, but they hug my waist and butt well, and can take me from a night at the ballet to horseback-riding. The versatility and durability threaded throughout them from the start still remains.</li>

<li class="dickiesarticle">
Today, I have my specific style - the Loose Fit Double-Knee Work Pant - and size - 30x32, and buying pants isn't the struggle it once was. The only difficulty is choosing what color to buy.</li>
